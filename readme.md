## How we worked?
We all worked together as a team and wrote down our tasks in ticket. With the help of Jira, we had the possibility to have all stories in one overview and knew the scope. In a 2-week cycle, we always set ourselves specific tasks to complete. This way we were able to keep the schedule well
